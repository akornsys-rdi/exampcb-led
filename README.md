Simple example pcb

## Intention ##
Board designed to serve as a simple example of design in CAD. It is also designed to be easy to solder, cheap and straightforward.

## Functioning ##
This analog circuit fade a LED off and on smoothly, using a single rail power (5V).

## ToDo ##
Changes to be implemented in the next version:
- Power over USB. miniUSB or microUSB?
- Footprint for capacitors to 200mil
- Replace the LED divisor by a resistive divider or zener.
- In silkscreen, change the text "YELLOW" by the text "LED"
- Increase the version number

## Derivative ##
This design is a revision of the original made for *OSHWCon 2011* by *Synusia* (kwendenarmo).
