This example PCB board is designed to serve as a simple example of design in 
CAD. It is also designed to be easy to solder, cheap and straightforward. This 
analog circuit fade a LED off and on smoothly, using a single rail power (5V). 
This design is a revision of the original made for _OSHWCon 2011_ by _Synusia_ 
(kwendenarmo).

ExamPCB LED is free hardware. See License Information below.
